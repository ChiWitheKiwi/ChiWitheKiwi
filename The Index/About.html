  <p> Hi I'm Richard Nubla and I like juxtaposition. I am an aspiring animator studying Digital Media Arts at San Jose State University, and am hoping to get into a Master's Program for animation. I really like to make things in general, and so I like to work in many different mediums. Traditional, Digital, 3-D; I think I've made some pretty cool stuff in all shapes and forms. The ones I use most often however, would be traditional mediums, such as chalk pastels, charcoal, pencil, on canvases that are much larger than a piece of printer paper, along with digital mediums, such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Animate.<p>
    <p> For me, art has always been the plan since I was a kid. Even through all the negative feedback that I've gotten from choosing to study art, I've stuck with it because I believe it is what I am meant to do. I couldn't tell you how I got into practicing art, but I know that I kept doing it because it felt right; making things and constantly growing myself and my trade because of it felt right. My grandmother always told me to become an engineer or a chemist because I always showed promise in those fields as well, and sure, maybe I could've tried to do those things, and maybe I could make a good amount of money, but money isn't everything, and I believe that doing something you love is much more important.
      <p> More recently, I have been collaborating with other students to make some videogames. I am working as an animator and designer to help envision characters and assets and bring them to life. I have worked on 4 games as of 2020.
